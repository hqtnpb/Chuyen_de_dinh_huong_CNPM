                                In 1951 we opened our doors in New York City, with a clear focus on customer service as we offered the very first complete vacation package. Soon after, we were helping Americans discover the world with international trips. Today, from being a part of one of the world’s largest travel companies, Flight Centre Travel Group to supporting small travel businesses with Independent by Liberty Travel, our commitment to creating connections, providing one-on-one service, and crafting the perfect vacation remains stronger than ever.
